# RBXAntiBackshot
A script to help you take action against a prevalent behavior in Roblox games wherein one user presses W and S behind another player, thus looking like they're giving them "backshots".

This behavior is highly problematic due to the fact that it is inherently a sexual innuendo, which is not only prohibited by Roblox Terms of Service, but additionally the person on the receiving end typically is not friends with the person doing it or otherwise okay with this behavior.

-- IMPLEMENTATION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. --
